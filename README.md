(The previous Eclipse based version of this project is in [commit #f110aa](https://github.com/opendatakit/aggregate/commit/f110aa938099ef0e596868bec057b6a3fa9ddabe)) 
 
ODK Aggregate provides a ready-to-deploy server and data repository to:

- provide blank forms to ODK Collect (or other OpenRosa clients),
- accept finalized forms (submissions) from ODK Collect and manage collected data,
- visualize the collected data using maps and simple graphs,
- export data (e.g., as CSV files for spreadsheets, or as KML files for Google Earth), and
- publish data to external systems (e.g., Google Spreadsheets or Google Fusion Tables).

ODK Aggregate can be deployed on Google's App Engine, enabling users to quickly get running without facing the complexities of setting up their own scalable web service. ODK Aggregate can also be deployed locally on a Tomcat server (or any servlet 2.5-compatible (or higher) web container) backed with a MySQL or PostgreSQL database server.

## Release cycle

TBD

## Setting up your development environment

1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and add it to your PATH

1. Download and install [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) 

1. Fork the Aggregate project ([why and how to fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))

1. Clone your fork of the project locally. At the command line:

        git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/aggregate

If you prefer not to use the command line, you can use IntelliJ to create a new project from version control using `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/aggregate`. 

Now you can open the project in the folder of your clone from IntelliJ and follow the [IntelliJ setup instructions](./docs/intellij_setup.md)

Be sure to read other documents:

- This projects uses a lot of Gradle tasks. Read the [Using the Gradle Command-Line](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_gradle_command_line.html) to learn how to work with them.
- [Installer generation document](./docs/installer_generation.md)
 
## Contributing

Any and all contributions to the project are welcome. ODK Aggregate is used across the world primarily by organizations with a social purpose so you can have real impact!

If you're ready to contribute code, see [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The best way to help us test is to build from source! We are currently focusing on stabilizing the build process.

- We are transitioning from an Eclipse/Ant build to a Gradle fully automated build system. If you have experience in GWT, Gradle or Google App Engine you probably can help us improve the build process and development flow.

- We are focusing on Google App Engine and Tomcat 8.0 + PostgreSQL support. You can help by building and testing Aggregate with other RDBs like MySQL and SQLServer.
