# ODK Aggregate - Build and run a Docker image

## Requirements

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- Already have a PostgreSQL 9.6 database running
- Follow the instructions of the main [README](https://github.com/opendatakit/aggregate), including:
  - Install Git LFS, as well as its git hooks, and enable the git hooks for Git LFS.
  - Only then clone your fork of Aggregate - included .jar files only download correctly with Git LFS. See [Getting the code](https://github.com/opendatakit/aggregate#getting-the-code).
  - Install IntelliJ IDEA and import project as instructed to let IDEA download, build, and configure sources. See [Running the project - Import](https://github.com/opendatakit/aggregate#import)

  *Note*: this is a gentle reminder to follow the main [README](https://github.com/opendatakit/aggregate), not a comprehensive setup guide in itself.

## Quick start - External PostgreSQL instance

This Aggregate Docker image works by using an external running PostgreSQL 9.6 database. The following quick start steps assume you have access to a PostgreSQL server and it's the first time you will be running Aggregate. 

- Connect to your database server using `psql` or any other PostgreSQL client program. 

- Create a database and a schema by running this SQL script:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER "aggregate" WITH PASSWORD 'aggregate';
  CREATE DATABASE aggregate WITH OWNER aggregate;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE aggregate TO aggregate;
  \connect aggregate;
  CREATE SCHEMA aggregate;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA aggregate TO aggregate;
  ```
  
  **We strongly advice to use a stronger password on the first line of the script.**
  
- Take note of the database connection parameters: host, port, database name, username and password.
  
- Build the Docker image with `./gradlew clean dockerBuild -xtest -PwarMode=complete`.

  Take note of the tag of the created image. It will appear in a message like this one:
  
  ```
  ...
  Successfully built bf09fb92a6e9
  Successfully tagged aggregate:v1.6.0-beta.0-dirty
  ```

- Launch Aggregate with `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -it --name=aggregate aggregate:v1.6.0-beta.0-dirty`
 
  Replace the version with the one you got when building the image and the database params accordingly.
  
  If you set another password, add a `-e DB_PASSWORD="%THE PASSWORD%` to the launch command before the `aggregate:v1.6.0-beta.0-dirty` part. [More info here](#configuration-parameters)
  
  Access Aggregate at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

- You can get the logs with `docker logs aggregate`

- Stop Aggregate with `docker stop aggregate`

- Start Aggregate again with `docker start aggregate`

## Advanced topics

## About this Docker image

- The base of this Docker image is [tomcat:8.0-jre8-alpine](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/tomcat/remote/8.0-jre8-alpine.md)

## Configuration parameters

You can set the following environment variables when running the Aggregate Docker image:

| variable | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AGGREGATE_HOST | localhost | Value of the `security.server.hostname` conf parameter. Set to `auto` for FQDN auto-discovery |
| DB_HOST | localhost | Value used to build the `jdbc.url` conf parameter |
| DB_PORT | 5432 | Value used to build the `jdbc.url` conf parameter |
| DB_NAME | aggregate | Value used to build the `jdbc.url` conf parameter |
| DB_SCHEMA | aggregate | Value of the `jdbc.schema` conf parameter |
| DB_USERNAME | aggregate | Value of the `jdbc.username` conf parameter |
| DB_PASSWORD | aggregate | Value of the `jdbc.password` conf parameter |

  These variables can be set by adding `--env VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE` arguments when running the Aggregate Docker image ([more info in the docs](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/getting-started/deploy-app/6_define_environment_variables/#python-quickstart)). Example:
  
  ```shell 
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -it \
  --env AGGREGATE_HOST="odk.somedomain.com" \ 
  --name=aggregate aggregate:v1.6.0-beta.0-dirty
  ```

- All these conf parameters are explained in the [ODK Aggregate - Configuration files](./aggregate-config.md) document
- If you are running your PostgreSQL server in the same host where you want to run the Aggregate Docker image you will probably need to add the `--network=host` argument when running it to allow the container access the host's services.
- If you need to serve Aggregate in a different host port, use Docker's networking configuration options to redirect the guest's 8080 port to any other host port ([more info in the docs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/))
